const admin = require('firebase-admin');

// Initialize Firebase Admin (you'll need to set up credentials)
// For now, let's create a simple script to check the database

console.log('Checking user requests for lyin3922@gmail.com...');

// This script would connect to Firestore and check:
// 1. user_requests collection for userId matching lyin3922@gmail.com
// 2. Check the structure and status of recent requests
// 3. Verify they're using the new UserRequest format

// Since we can't run this directly without Firebase credentials,
// let's check via the Flutter app's debug output instead
